                Hello my name is Mario, and I am a computer science major.
                I have just finished two years at Mesa Community College. In the fall
                I will attend Arizona State University to obtain my bachelor's degree
                in computer science. I aspire to learn more about computer science as my years 
                continue and I cannot wait to learn about the industry side
                of the career. 
            </p>
