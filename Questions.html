                    I started out learning Java my first year of college. Ever since

                <h4 class="question">What languages are you familiar with?</h4>    
                <p class="answer">I started out learning Java my first year of college
                    making it my first language. Afterward I started learning C++,Racket,
                    a bit of Prolog in my Intro to Different Programming Languages course.
                    My last semester of college I also learned how to use Assembly language.
                    In my free time, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I also learned
                    how to use my knowledge of Java through Android development in Android
                    Studio.

                    What got you into computer science?
                </h4>
                <p class="answer">
                    At first I was interested about computers the first time I saw one at the library.
                    I was amazed and filled with wonder about how computers worked. My fascination grew
                    over time especially when I built my first pc at 16 years old. After that day, I 
                    knew I wanted to focus on a technology racer and I always excelled at math, which
                    made majoring in computer science a no-brainer.
